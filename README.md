# maoai
An AI that plays the card game Mao, in which new players must learn rules as they play.

To play the game, clone the repo and run with "python gameplay.py" 
Any number of players (both human and AI) is appropriate.
Play a card by indicating the index of the appropriate card in your hand (starting at index 0).
"Special actions" should be separated by spaces.
For instance, to play the first card in your hand and dance, the player would say "0 dance" when prompted for a move.
When there are no appropriate cards, any integer can be typed; there is no need for any special actions.
To end the game at any point, say "gg ez" when prompted for a move (or, alternatively, any string will result in crashing and exiting).
